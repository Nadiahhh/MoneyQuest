          <h1 id="Introduction"><b>Introduction</b></h1>
          <p>Finance is defined as the management of money and includes activities such as investing, borrowing, lending, budgeting, saving, and forecasting. There are three main types of finance: (1) personal, (2) corporate, and (3) public/government. 
            This guide will unpack the question: what is finance?</p>
          <br>
          In the Introduction to Finance I: The Basics course, you will be introduced to the basic concepts needed to understand the financial manager’s decision-making process. To achieve that, you will learn about the basic forms a business can take and the goal of the financial manager. You will also learn the fundamentals of financial statements and how to measure a company’s financial health using financial ratios. In addition, you will explore how to allocate capital across time to create value. After learning the course, you should be familiar with major topics in modern finance and communicate with others within and outside of the business world. With a deep understanding of the financial side of the business, you will be in a better position to make informed decisions and plan for the financial future.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1 id="what-is-finance"><b>What is Finance?</b></h1>
          <p>Finance is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments. 
            It involves the use of credit and debt, securities, and investment to finance current projects using future income flows. 
            Because of this temporal aspect, finance is closely linked to the time value of money, interest rates, and other related topics.</p>

            Finance can be broadly divided into three categories:
            <br>
            <br>- Public finance
            <br>- Corporate finance
            <br>- Personal finance
            <br>
            <br>"Finance" is typically broken down into three broad categories: Public finance includes tax systems, government expenditures, budget procedures, stabilization policy and instruments, debt issues, and other government concerns. Corporate finance involves managing assets, liabilities, revenues, and debts for a business. Personal finance defines all financial decisions and activities of an individual or household, including budgeting, insurance, mortgage planning, savings, and retirement planning.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h1 id="finance-real-world"><b>Finance in the Real World</b></h1>
          <p>Market cap—or market capitalization—refers to the total value of all a company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock by its total number of outstanding shares. For example, a company with 20 million shares selling at $50 a share would have a market cap of $1 billion.

            Why is market capitalization such an important concept? It allows investors to understand the relative size of one company versus another. Market cap measures what a company is worth on the open market, as well as the market's perception of its future prospects, because it reflects what investors are willing to pay for its stock. </p>
          Meanwhile, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals. 
          In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices. Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan.
          <br>
          <br>
          Dollar-cost averaging is a tool an investor can use to build savings and wealth over a long period. It is also a way for an investor to neutralize short-term volatility in the broader equity market. A prime example of dollar-cost averaging is its use in 401(k) plans, in which regular purchases are made regardless of the price of any given equity within the account.

In a 401(k) plan, an employee can select a predetermined amount of their salary that they wish to invest in a menu of mutual or index funds. When an employee receives their pay, the amount the employee has chosen to contribute to the 401(k) is invested in their investment choices.
