            <h1>WHAT IS SMART MONEY ABOUT?</h1> 
            <span class="flexing">
                
                <p>SmartMoney was originated from the hardships and experiences of two individuals who were unfamilliar in the finance world
                  and has found interest in it after researching and self-learning the terms and concepts of it online. Although there are existing
                  online resources that teaches everyone about finance, there are also difficulties and disadvantages of these platforms, in which
                  the creators of SmartMoney has encountered.
                    <br><br>
                  Learning everything about finance is complex, thus, this website is developed to make the learning journey easier to comprehend. In other
                  platforms, resources are separated, advanced and users are expected to have atleast a basic foundation on finance and the current trends
                  of it around the world. SmartMoney goes further back where individuals are welcomed to start from scratch and follow our thorough learning
                  plan for you to understand from simple financial terms to common trends and complicated concepts that can be applied in the real world.

            <h1>NADIAH UMMAIRAH</h1>
            <h3>Website Creator, Design</h3>
            <span class="flexing">
                <img src="images/about-nad.png" id="about-creat">
                <p>As stated above, my partner and I created SmartMoney due to our difficult experience of learning business and finances altogether. As I began
                  my course relating to business, I was taken aback by the sudden use of concepts and terms commonly used in the finance world. When I wanted to learn
                  more, online resources made everything more complicated for me as the answers and explanations were all in sections and had no continuous lessons. This 
                  made learning difficult and I had trouble understanding a simple concept that could have been taught in a few minutes.
                </p>

                <p>Therefore, when desigining SmartMoney, I decided to make this website suitable for people who are genuinely new to finance, those who are advanced
                  or even those who would like to try out for fun! We went with a gaming theme and quiz to make learning more fun! From my experience, learning on
                  financial platforms were dull and had many textbook answers. Hence, with a gamified experience, I hope it intrigues and encourages the user to continue
                  onto their adventure in the world of finance despite the increase level of difficulty to understand everything!
